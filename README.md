# Programming-for-computations-Python
Scripts and notes on scientific computing in Python

A book under the same title is available [here](http://hplgit.github.io/prog4comp/doc/pub/p4c-bootstrap-Python.html) and is the reference material which I worked through.

Unless stated at the top a script, assume that Python 2 is the language level. From chapter 3 onwards, I intend on completing the exercises in Python 3 and adding accompanying Jupyter notebooks.

+ Chapter 1: The First Few Steps
+ Chapter 2: Basic Constructions
